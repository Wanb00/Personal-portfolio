# Personal-portfolio

## Description
Personal portfolio webpage made as a project as part of freeCodeCamp and contains projects done as part of freeCodeCamp and Northcoders.
The main language the projects will be run in are JavaScript (JS) with supplementary languages assisting in the development such as HTML/CSS, SQL or react.
This portfolio utilises only HTML and CSS to create a responsive page that changes dependent on the users resolution, allowing for a more consistent viewing of the webpage.
Some struggles I faced during the project was creating the responsive resolution where some divs were responsive but others were not. To be specific the title/introduction section worked fine and so did the contacts page, however, the project segment did not work properly.

As I complete more projects, they will be added here along with their links inside the live page.
